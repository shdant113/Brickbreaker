# Brickbreaker

Brickbreaker (also known as Breakout or Arkanoid) is a popular, simple browser game with easy application across most browsers. It is not intended for mobile use at this time. 

This version of Brickbreaker was adapted by Spencer Dant as a project at GA. Having played so much Brickbreaker on his mom's Blackberry as a child that he actually learned to enjoy spending hours in the waiting room at doctor's offices, this project was extremely entertaining and nostalgic.  You can see for yourself at the link above.
